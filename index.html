            <h2>WEB</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web
                resources
                are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed
                via the
                Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first
                web
                browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was
                released
                outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the
                general public
                on the Internet in August 1991.
